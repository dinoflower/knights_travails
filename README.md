# Knights Travails

Prompt the program to move a knight from any starting location to any second location
on a standard 64-square chessboard, and it will tell you the shortest path to your
destination as well as each move made along the way.

Requires Ruby and runs in the command line.

## About

Program runs on load from knights_travails.rb. The program takes input from the user,
returns the result, and offers to restart in case the user would like to try another
pair of coordinates.

## Usage

Run:

$ ruby knights_travails.rb

The program will generate a labeled chessboard and ask for row and column numbers
for both squares.
